The nmon-logger for the Nmon Performance application for Splunk implements the excellent and powerful nmon binary known as Nigel's performance monitor.
Originally developed for IBM AIX performance monitoring and analysis, it is now an Open source project that made it available to many other systems.
It is fully available for any Linux flavor, and thanks to the excellent work of Guy Deffaux, it also available for Solaris 10/11 systems using the sarmon project.

The Nmon Performance monitor application for Splunk will generate performance and inventory data for your servers, and provides a rich number of monitors and tools to manage your AIX / Linux / Solaris systems.
