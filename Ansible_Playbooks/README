# Ansible Playbooks #
#####################

These are 2 Ansible Playbooks example you may want to use to automatically deploy and maintain the nmon-logger package using this powerful and easy to use Ansible tool.

Before using these playbooks, change a few settings according to your need:

1. hosts:

--> Set the host group destination that matches your need

2. docroot vars:

Default:

- docroot: /opt/deployment/nmon-logger

Set this variable to the full directory patch where you have cloned this git repository

Supplementary informations:

These playbooks will assume you have a root access to your hosts using a sudo acess.
If you use to deploy differently, this must be cuztomized.
